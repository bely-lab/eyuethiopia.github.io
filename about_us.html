											<h3>Our Values</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<b>Community First:</b> Eyu-Ethiopia is established with the primary aim of serving communities in need.  We put the people’s eye health first and strive and act timely to address their needs. I CARE is our motto.  <br>
											<b>Excellence:</b>  Quality is at the heart of Eyu-Ethiopia: We strive to deliver the highest quality service to our community guided with the best available evidence and technical expertise. We strive to continuously develop ourselves and innovate to respond to the public’s demand and a changing world. <br>												      
											<b>Commitment:</b>  We are committed in heart and mind to serve communities in need and realise Eyu-Ethiopia’s vision.<br>
											<b>Integrity & Respect:</b> We are honest, open, ethical, and fair. People trust us to adhere to our word and keep our promises. We strive to show a deep respect for people inside and outside our organisation and for the communities of which they are part.  We strive to make people feel safe, respected, empowered, fairly treated and duly recognized. Building a strong, trusting relationship with the community, stakeholders, and our employees, is our motto. We believe our employees are the backbone of our organisation. Respecting our employees means respecting their individual human rights and privacy, ensuring a safe and healthy workplace environment, and providing them a dynamic platform, where they can explore their creativity and skills and further enhance themselves.<br>
											<b>Accountability:</b>  We are liable and responsible for decisions made and actions taken, both personally and on behalf of our organisation. Eyu-Ethiopia expects its staff to achieve the highest professional standards and be transparent, resourceful, committed, trustworthy and loyal to serve communities in need of eye care services.<br>
											<b>Diversity & Neutrality:</b>  We believe it takes people with different ideas, strengths, interests, and cultural backgrounds to succeed. We explicitly prohibit all forms of discrimination, whether based on religion, belief, race, ethnicity, nationality, gender or physical disability, and rather encourage inclusiveness for diversified backgrounds and opinions, and provide equal opportunity for all. Eyu-Ethiopia is not affiliated with any political or religious organizations.  <br>
											<b>Collaboration:</b> We believe in collective efforts to achieve our goals. We work in conjunction with Community, Federal and State Governments of Ethiopia; and partner with the Ministry of Health and Regional Health Bureaus, various governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, and other individuals and groups working on the same area within and outside Ethiopia. Eyu-Ethiopia avoids duplicating the efforts of other organisations or individuals.<br>

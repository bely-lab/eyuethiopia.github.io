											<b>Ethiopia</b>, the second most populous country in Africa with over 100 million inhabitants, has among the highest burden of <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment">visual impairment</a> worldwide. Despite this huge burden, there are no adequate eye care services in most parts of the country and those existing are unsustainable, disease-focused vertical programmes with limited or no integration with the wider health system. Although there are cost-effective treatment strategies for eye care, there is insufficient evidence on how to implement these interventions to address the huge needs of communities in resource limited settings such as in Ethiopia. There is no adequate rehabilitation and support service for people with low vision. Low vision is a vision impairment that cannot be fully corrected by regular eyeglasses, contact lenses, medication, or surgery. <br>
											<br>
											Eyu-Ethiopia works in all regions of the country to address these gaps by: <b>(1)</b> generating evidence through research, <b>(2)</b> building capacity of communities and eye care professionals and <b>(3)</b> integrating eye care service delivery into existing healthcare systems.

														<header>
															<h2>Funding:</h2>
														</header>
														<p>
															This study is funded by the Neglected Tropical Diseases Support Center at the Task Force for Global Health.  
														</p>
														<header>
															<h2>Aim:</h2>
														</header>
														<p>
															This project aims to explore the impact of the blinding stage of trachoma (Trachomatous Trichiasis) on common mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and suicidality. 
														</p>
														<header>
															<h2>Background:</h2>
														</header>
														<p>
															Trachoma is one of the most common NTDs, and the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. The blinding stage of Trachoma, Trachomatous Trichiasis (TT), causes painful corneal abrasion which ultimately leads to irreversible visual impairment from corneal opacity. The considerable pain and visual impairment from TT leads to functional and physical impairment, social withdrawal and exclusion, inability to work and earn income, which would result in low self-esteem, loss of sense of security, feeling of shame, and emotional distress leading to mental disorders.  However, no quantitative study has been conducted to explore the impact that the blinding stag of trachoma has on the mental health of affected communities.  In a recent NTD summit organized by the WHO, it was recognized that the mental health consequences of NTDs have been ignored and that researches exploring this in detail are needed.  
														</p>
														<header>
															<h2>Project Description:</h2>
														</header>
														<p>
															This project has two study components:  First, we will validate a generic stigma tool for measuring and monitoring self and community inflicted stigma in TT patients.  No quantitative tools have been validated and used to measure stigma in TT patients. Once validated this tool can be adapted and used in various settings. Second, we will measure the impact of TT on three common mental disorders: depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and suicidal behavior and their drivers in comparative cross-sectional study using standard quantitative tools. The findings from these two studies would help to generate evidence and identify the unmet mental health care needs of trachoma affected communities. The results would be used to encourage allocation of resources for NTDs and common mental disorders to ensure that marginalized communities suffering from co-morbidities have access to basic, comprehensive and affordable health care services. The whole project will be completed and reported within 14-months.
